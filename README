************ PROGRAM FOR SIMULATION OF LATTICE YANG-MILLS THEORIES ***********
******************************************************************************


** ACTION
*****************************************************
The action used is the standard Wilson action, which for the N colors can be
generically written as the sum of

-beta*(1/N)\sum_{plaquettes} Re(Tr(paquette))

and possibly a theta therm. If --enable-imaginary-theta is used during
configuration an imaginary theta term is used of the form

-theta_im*Top_charge

where the simplest discretization with definite parity of the topological
charge is used (see later "A note on the topological charge" for more details).

In yang_mills_tracedef a trace deformation is also added to the action, of the
form

\sum_{sites on a spatial slice} \sum_{i=0}^{N/2} h_i|Tr(polyakov^{i+1})|^2

The update is performed by means of heatbath and overrelaxation updates (and in
some case also Metropolis updates) implemented a la Cabibbo-Marinari.

In yang_mills_local_fundadj the action is

-beta*(1/N)\sum_{plaquettes} Re(Tr(paquette)) 
-adjbeta*(1/(N*N-1))\sum_{plaquettes} Tr_adj(paquette)

and Tr_adj=|Tr_fund|^2-1.

In yang_mills_higgs the action is 

-beta*(1/N)\sum_{plaquettes} Re(Tr(paquette)) 
-N_higgs*higgs_beta\sum_{r, mu}\sum_{i=1}^{N_higgs} Re([H_r^{(i)}]^{\dag} U_{r, mu} H_{r+mu}^{(i)} )

where the sum on mu is just on positive orientations and Higgs fields are
normalized according to

\sum_{i=1}^{N_higgs} \|H_r^{(i)}\|^2 = 1 

for every site r.


** OTHER CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The choice of the gauge group happens at configuration time through the macros
Gauge_Group and N_c. Two classes of gauge groups are implemented, the SoN and
SuN classes (with N_c=1 for SuN corresponding to the U(1) gauge theory). As an
example, to simulate the SU(5) gauge theory the program has to be configured
using

./configure Gauge_Group=SuN N_c=5

Relevant configure options are

--enable-use-openmp     to enable the use of openmp
--enable-use-theta      to enable the use of an imaginary theta term

and the following macro are availbale

Gauge_Group  the gauge group (SuN or SoN, default SuN)
N_c          the number of colors (default 2)
Num_levels   the number of levels in multilevel (default 1)
Num_threads  number of threads to be used in OpenMP (default 1)
ST_dim       spacetime dimensionality (default 4)
N_higgs      the number of Higgs fields (default 1)


After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make

Defining the macro DEBUG several sanity checks are activated, while the macros
OPT_MULTIHIT and OPT_MULTILEVEL can be used to optimize the number of multihit
steps and the number of updates to be used in the multilevel algorithm.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling executables without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.

Some conventions used in the code are the following:

time is direction 0 and the numbers follosing "size" in the imput are in the
order "time space1 space2 ..."

when computing Polyakov loop correlators, Polyakov loops are separated along
direction 1 and, when computing flux tube profiles, the transverse direction is
direction 2 

level 0 of the multilevel is the one corresponding to the largest
timeslice.


** A NOTE ON THE TOPOLOGICAL CHARGE
*********************************************************

Topology for the general group: in the continuum the topological charge is
defined in 4 space-time dimensions by

Q=\frac{1}{64 \pi^2} \int \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
   F_{\mu\nu}^a F_{\rho\sigma}^a d^x

with the normalization Tr(T_iT_j)=K \delta_{ij} such that the longest root of
the representation is normalized to 1.
[see C. W. Bernard, N. H. Christ, A. H. Guth, E. J. Weinberg 
 Phys. Rev. D 16, 2967 (1977) ]

For SU(N) this base is that of the generalized Gell-Mann matrices divided by
two and in this representation Tr(T^aT^b)=(1/2)\delta^{ab}, so that 

F_{\mu\nu}^aF_{\rho\sigma}^a=2Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma})

and thus 

Q=\frac{1}{32 \pi^2} \int \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
Tr(F_{\mu\nu} F_{\rho\sigma}) d^x

The discretization used on the lattice is obtained by using the clover form of
the discretized field-strenth, i.e. the clover Q_{\mu\nu} is given by

Q_{\mu\nu}  ~ 4 + 4 i a^2 F_{\mu\nu}

and thus

F_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{8i}( Q_{\mu\nu} - Q_{\mu\nu}^{dag} )  

By using this expression we get

Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma}) = 
          =-\frac{1}{2^5} ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}])

We now note that of the 24 terms
\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} only 3 are independent:

2: single exchange on the first term   F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} ->
                                               F_{\nu\mu}F_{\rho\sigma}
2: single exchange on the second term  F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -> 
                                               F_{\mu\nu}F_{\sigma\rho}
2: exchage                             F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma} -> 
                                               F_{\rho\sigma}F_{\mu\nu} 
3: remaining permutations of indices: e.g 0123, 0213, 0312

thus 

\frac{1}{32} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}Tr(F_{\mu\nu}F_{\rho\sigma})=

 =-\frac{1}{32} * \frac{1}{2^5} * 2^3 * [ sum on independent permutations
              of \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
              ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}]) ]
  
 =-\frac{1}{128} [ sum on independent permutations
              of \epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} 
              ReTr(Q_{\mu\nu}[Q_{\rho\sigma}-Q_{\rho\sigma}^{dag}]) ]

This is the expression used in the code.
